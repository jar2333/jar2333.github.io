As I read chapter 1 of David Bentley Hart’s _The Light of Tabor: Toward a Monistic Christology_, I find it important to grasp why I'm more drawn to a dualistic Divine/created ontology. It is, indubitably, due to my own experience with God. Of being on "this side", surely of unbelief, but beyond that, of profound ignorance to the religious drive and the power of symbols which produce it. The leap of faith was not just unbelief to belief, but the intuited (perhaps revealed) apprehension of the _here_ and the _there_, the sublime and the mundane, the sacred and the profane, the Divine and the created, and all the cosmic enormity entailed thereafter. The perception of God as _God,_ the “not-this” and the “not-that”, but impossibly, unmistakably the Good; this qualia being properly called _the state of faith_. The inherent duality in the conversion experience, and the revelatory unveiling of analogous dyadic contrasts, are self-similar. 

But further beyond, the beauty of the Incarnation with respect to this newly internalized duality, is a harmony so graciously, so mercifully manifest in the Person(a) of Christ, in all the motifs, epithets, and signifieds embodied through Him by virtue of either full Divinity and full humanity: that the identity of Christ be a microcosm of absolute totality, "**Christ is all and in all"** (Colossians 3:11). This coming to faith in the Gospel does not only evince the great, all-encompassing rift between the One and man, a despairing proposition in itself (James 2:19), but at once the apex instantiation of reconciliation in the God-man Christ Jesus: that faith be commensurate with the means requisite of salvific efficacy in Christ, as that leap is no lesser miracle than God become man, than man be made divine. The acquisition of faith and salvation are mythopoetically isomorphic, and hence fittingly, interweaved as gradations of the same motif. These follow a clear phenomenological hierarchy of belief, understanding, then union, the enrapture of the subject within the fullness of this revelation being proof in itself of its sublimity, its comprehensive, totalizing, self-sufficient Truth of having beheld Truth.

That being said, I have also felt disgruntled by how unsatisfactory this answer was over time, outside bouts of euphoric Understanding, if only because of how little credence it gives to ancient, well-trodden experience of God's immanence, God's "here-ness", which as Hart writes, is irrevocably transformed by the anti-Arian, post-Nicene framework of a fundamental border between God and creature:

> Neither the difference between _creatio ex nihilo_ and mere demiurgy nor the difference between divine begetting and divine making could any longer remain comfortably uncertain; much less could those two differences remain inextricably entangled with one another. In every sense, the interval between the "there above" and the "here below", which had for so long been a spacious realm of inexact and relative degrees of the divine and natural, now had to contract into an inviolable line of demarcation.[^1]

This new scheme did gift us the understanding of God as the _interior intimo_, being so anterior to creation as to inhabit it all in equal measure[^2]. But, this in turn required innovations like the energies of Neo-Palamism to account for intermediary roles previously occupied by the angelomorphic _deuteros theos_[^3] (at other times, the _Ruach Ha'Qodesh, or the Shekinah_)[^4]. These two, Logos and Spirit, having been subsumed into the Divine identity, the Divine _ousia_, could no longer be appropriately (or at least, correctly)[^5] construed as maintaining this traditional mediatorship, the one which made the Trinity idea plausible historically. Although all in all, God becomes more of an abstract "ground of Being" in His most immanent, this demarcation— the alienating rift between us and God _qua_ God —is preserved. 

To an extent, this serves a Christocentric understanding beautifully: The God-man is the sublimest mystery, a productive paradox, a wonderful impossibility internalized and validating all the absurdities of faith, encompassing the gamut of devotional archetypes, e.g. the ever-caring Good Shepherd and the all-powerful Pantocrator.

This, in turn, uproots an entire generation's schemata of the immanent God. Of all those ancient theological ideas swept up in this radical separation of God and man, I find the notion of the angelomorphic "pre-Incarnate Christ" to be a most direct victim of the newly unqualified deity of Logos, and indicative of this enriched import necessarily afforded to the Incarnation as the most consequential of God's modes of immanence. In the work of St. Justin Martyr, his subordinationist Logos Christology grounds all Old Testament theophanies, all therefore Christophanies, leaving Christ's intercessory functions as both the Word of God and the human Messiah inextricably enmeshed. 

As the Logos' primitive form of inherent immanence is interpreted away and even labeled outright heresy, especially if appearing in the teachings of anyone canonized before the early 300s, Christ's humanity is increasingly clung to as God's "here-ness". To not dismiss Logos theologies like St. Justin's with callous disregard, one must now "flatten" Christ's humanity across time and space, a glorified humanity able to present itself before its creation in time. I am not Reformed, and see no need to interpret away the _possibility_ of such extra-spatial or extra-temporal feats by the risen Lord (John 20:19).  Nevertheless, any scheme which _necessitates_ a time-traveling man, or pressing still, a requisite mechanism of Christ's "human energies" (whatever that means in a _truly human_ way) to explain any non-visionary, tangible or even anthropomorphic presence of God, is very strange! 

It is a common, recurring understanding across all religions, that there is a sense in which God can be known to us, even outside the wonder of Christ's Incarnation, as God. Some, like Hart, go the extra mile and posit a monistic understanding, in the vein of Neo-Platonic emanationism. I am not expressly opposed to this, but I am skeptical. I pray that Hart is able to tread the lines between tapping into this intuition, and disregarding the primacy of Jesus in mediation with God, as Logos, as King, Prophet, and Priest, as Christ.

All I can say with certainty is that God Himself is an inexhaustible paradox, at once nearest and furthest, light and darkness, present and absent, inside and outside, part and whole. That then these be One, would be a mystery fitting of God most of all.

[^6]: The Ancient of Days, so readily interpreted as a vision of the Father (or at least, a symbol of Him), is instead argued as a vision of Christ the Logos, as the sole image of the Father. The Fathers of the Eastern Church maintained this strong concept of phenomenological mediatorship in their tradition, carried on from earlier Logos theologies. This results in depictions of God the Father being rare in practice, and images of Jesus used to depict Divinity in most cases. Such an comprehensive usurping of any potential cathexis aimed at God by the Person of the Son is only appropriate, I could argue, under the strong Nicene language of "homoousios", which nevertheless counter-intuitively undermines the necessity of this very mediatorship, instead existing by fiat in the economic Trinity well outside the realm of ontology.
