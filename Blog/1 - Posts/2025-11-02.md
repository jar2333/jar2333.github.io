There is something to be admired about the intuitive correspondence between the ontology and the phenomenology of God in emanationism. That God's One Light be perceived via different lenses, some closer than others but all conveying the One Light, and pointing to its source, to borrow some Kabbalistic analogy. The question naturally arises as to whether one should direct prayer to these lenses or not. What about worship? <!-- Talk about the questions in Boyarin's paper on Metatron, some kabbalistic speculation, then early Christian views (two sections: still in emanation-land, in which case explore the gnostics, but then explore the more general Logos theologies), then even tying it to Nicea II (7th encumenical council, with respect to ideas of image, signification, and transference to signified of honor, for some reason)  --> <!-- Talk about my earlier scheme of  a hierarchy in the Godhead working out perfectly to answer the problem of immanence ontologically and the problem of immanence phenomenologically (theophany), how their split is a tragedy (Add Hart's quotes about the hierarchy being broken, quote the interview? See if the book has this too) -->

Response to Lizzy:
I do see these two views as just part and parcel of the Christian's dynamic with the Lord. Total submission and merciful union in grace, somehow, at once fully realized. I wouldn't feel compelled to seek out deity that lacks either, and in fact, their reconciliation in itself
