[{"content":"As the clock strikes midnight, the itch to write a blog post won\u0026rsquo;t leave my mind. But\u0026hellip; What am I supposed to write about when I have nothing to say? Why should I even do so? There exists a smidgen of merit in the fact that simply doing is its own form of practice, or at the very least grants the comfort of having exercised something. In my case, the use of vocabulary that otherwise goes neglected certainly aids future writing sessions. Just having these words floating around after recent deployment keeps me from blanking out too hard the next time. The habit-formation is also good enough reason.\nIf I really want to be cynical about it though, writing about anything at all also makes me feel like I had anything to say, even when it isn’t necessarily true. And is it really in this case? Being dragged along by some ill-formed sense of obligation to shit out whatever comes to mind? Because that’s really all this is, however “meta” it tries to come across. It was simply easier to write about my lack of topics as a topic-in-itself. I feel a bit embarrassed about this, contemplating whether this nothing-piece should pollute the \u0026ldquo;Blog\u0026rdquo; category at all.\nIs this exercise so bad though? It does get to the heart of what motivates me to write at all. For, if I did not enjoy the act in itself, would I still be typing right now? Would I have expended the effort to finish this sentence? Maybe it’s best for me to get this crutch out of my system and sit on it for a bit. After digesting this screed, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll come to terms with the reality that sometimes I really do have nothing to yap about. Hey, that’s another reason to do this: self-reflection. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll even hone the ability to harmonize the requisite acquisition of substance with the ever-present drive to write. Baby steps.\n","date":"2024-12-03T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/forced-metacommentary/","title":"Forced Metacommentary"},{"content":"Obtaining a rice cooker has been one of the best kitchen boons ever. Given how prominent rice is in the staple Puerto Rican dishes (rice \u0026amp; beans, yellow rice, etc\u0026hellip;), being able to effortlessly make it means I get to spend less time cooking and more time doing anything else! Not to disparage cooking of course, as I derive a lot of enjoyment from it. But admittedly, cooking is a huge time sink. Being able to use the stove-top for the meats or beans while having rice cook in the background is a big time-saver, and reduces cognitive load.\nWith that newfound efficiency, I was able to whip up a quick dish that ended up surprisingly delicious. It\u0026rsquo;s probably my best attempt at yellow rice, and I figured I\u0026rsquo;d document it for my own future use. The dish itself is very versatile, as the vegetables can be replaced for anything you might like. As for the meat, any fatty meats work really well, such that the rice gets infused with the flavors of the meat. A good alternative is bacon.\nIngredients: 2 cups of rice (I used medium grain) 2.5 cups of water 1/2 of a Kielbasa sausage, sliced 1/2 a red onion, diced (alt. 1 yellow onion) 3 cloves of garlic, minced 1 red bell pepper, coarsely chopped (can used canned) 2 white mushrooms, thinly sliced 2 green olives, sliced in half A few leaves of fresh cilantro 1 tablespoon of sofrito 1 packet of chicken bouillon (alt. replace water with chicken stock) 1/2 packet of sazón (alt. annatto, cumin, garlic powder \u0026amp; MSG) 3 pinches of salt 1 tablespoon of olive oil 1/2 tablespoon of butter Steps Put the olive oil in a pot, and wait until hot. Drop the onions, pepper, and mushroom, and fry for 3-4 minutes while stirring until softened. Then, add the Kielbasa, garlic, cilantro, and sofrito, still stirring. Let sit for another 3-4 minutes. Turn off the heat.\nAdd the rice and the water to a rice cooker. Add the olives, chicken bouillon, sazón, butter, salt, and the rest of the ingredients in the pot to the rice cooker. Mix together until the bouillon, sazón and salt are dissolved. Turn on the rice cooker and let cook. Once it finishes, serve.\nNOTE: The rice cooker might finish early, leaving the rice undercooked. If so, move the rice around, making sure to scrape the bottom to prevent burning of the rice. Drizzle a couple of teaspoons of water to the rice, spread across the bowl. Then, turn it on again. Once it finishes, let the steam inside sit for about 5 minutes to let the rice fully cook.\n","date":"2024-12-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/recipe-kielbasa-yellow-rice/","title":"Recipe: Kielbasa Yellow Rice"},{"content":"As I sit in my heated studio apartment, staring out at the building scheduled for demolition right outside my window, I ponder how much time has passed, and how little has changed. Like that building, my time also will eventually come. Reflecting further on death, I ascertained that its consequence I fear most is the misattribution of dreams and misunderstanding of character directed towards an isolated, unrealized me. That I will be buried along with my unfulfilled goals and unexpressed insights, my thoughts decomposing in the dark underground instead of circulating via lively conversations or publications. I suppose this means I conflate the fulfillment of my aspirations to a yet unrealized level of self-expression, as is fitting for a budding writer. This cements in my mind the idea that authorship is my long-held dream.\nAncillary goals spring forth from this fact: the frustratingly unmet reading quotas, an increasingly binding obligation to jot down my thoughts in a more organized routine, and the acquisition of sociological, psychological and philosophical knowledge in service of my writing —be it essays in these areas, or incorporating their insights into the various facets of composing prose fiction. These still seem so far from the current me, the software developer too busy with work. More accurately, too disorganized to properly cope with my weekly workload while also finding time to start these first steps. I think this is the worst aspect of entering the work-force with a comparatively low wage, and no affordable/nearby access to further higher education. I feel buried already.\nI’ll keep trying, I guess. I think for now my short term goal should be to increase my wage, to save up for a potential move. There are various nearby areas with good academic institutions, not excluding Toronto. I’ll work on my routine and try to make more time for this blog (Thanksgiving break being my only recent opportunity), and make a habit of reading. On that front, I’ve been going through Sociology by Anthony Giddens. Maybe that will stimulate my essay chops enough to vomit out something in the coming months. Fingers crossed…\nArt by Tsukumizu (@lililjiliijili on twitter.com)\n","date":"2024-11-30T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/p/thanksgiving-break-a-brief-respite-for-the-begrudgingly-reticent/7_hu57764375533067173.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/thanksgiving-break-a-brief-respite-for-the-begrudgingly-reticent/","title":"Thanksgiving Break: A Brief Respite for the Begrudgingly Reticent"},{"content":"Even now as I sit here writing this, I am wracked with an intense hesitance. Not without reason, as I promised myself that I’d go to sleep by midnight, so as to avoid the inevitable complications. Here I sit at the kitchen counter, staring at the dishes dirty in the sink, having taken a Benadryl, neglecting my resolve to actually do a thing for once (or, to do nothing, I suppose?). At the very least, one of these failures in the venture of habit formation constitutes some tangible progress in the form of a first step: an acknowledgment. That I did set this goal for myself, that I did work up to it (having cut a conversation among friends adequately short), and that it simply did not work out, as my mind was too preoccupied with the current matter to sleep. No excuses for the dishes, however…\nWhy am I writing now? It is because I have been skirting around a bigger failure of autonomy for a few years by now. One that has been chipping away at whatever pretentious notion of self-determination I might be intellectually parading at any given moment. One that points to my fear of failing to live up to my own aspirations, reinforcing the very same conditions for its own grievance like a dastardly, ever-looping Ouroboros. One that continuously debases the very breath I utter whenever it claims to want to write only to fade into a few choice ears.\nNevertheless, I declare this small act of self-expression to be my first step. With my flag of conquest in hand, and a suspiciously pen-shaped lance on the other, I’ll charge towards the terrifying dragon. I might be paralyzed in fear every once in a while. In fact, right now I am horrified at the prospect of mocking on-lookers, jeering at my judicious use of filler phrases, pompous parenthetical pondering, among other chinks in my armor. In any case, the intention is to victoriously reclaim my resolve from the self-justifying paradox of failing to fail. Let us hope this Ouroborous isn’t also part Hydra! :]\n","date":"2024-09-30T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/p/the-failure-to-fail-is-a-delicious-dereliction/quijote_hu1164021169985730577.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/the-failure-to-fail-is-a-delicious-dereliction/","title":"The Failure to Fail is a Delicious Dereliction"}]
